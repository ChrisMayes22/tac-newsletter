                    Dan is a Wake Forest native who graduated from NC State with a B.A. in Public and Interpersonal Communication. 
                    Dan has always had an affinity for academic coaching, as he spent much of his time tutoring local middle and 
                    high school students in a wide range of academic subjects, including AP English & Calculus. Nowadays, Dan’s favorite 
                    academic subject to teach is college test prep as he is inspired by seeing his students produce tremendous score improvement 
                    and achieve their goals. In his spare time, he is constructing a high school level Intro to Communication curriculum that 
                    he hopes to get implemented by local school districts in the near future.
